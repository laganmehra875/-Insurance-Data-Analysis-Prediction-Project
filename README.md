# -Insurance-Data-Analysis-Prediction-Project
This project analyzes an insurance dataset to identify key factors affecting medical charges. It includes data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and preparation of a model-ready dataset.



## **🔍 Project Overview**

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and data preprocessing on an Insurance dataset to understand the key factors affecting medical insurance charges.
The goal is to clean the data, analyze patterns, transform categorical variables, and prepare a model-ready dataset for further machine learning tasks.

## **Insurance Raw Dataset used :**

## **🎯 Problem Statement**

Insurance companies need to understand what factors influence medical insurance charges so they can:

1. Price policies accurately
2. Identify high-risk customers
4. Improve business decisions

This project analyzes variables like age, BMI, smoking habits, gender, region, and children to study their impact on insurance charges.
